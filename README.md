## Introduction
The *Arisia Platform* is the software platform for the rapid application software development.
The [ArisiaCard](./ArisiaCard/README.md) is an implementation of it.

For rapid application development, the following matters are required:
* The programming language that allows writing your ideas directory.
* Rich built-in components that eliminate the needs to reinvent the wheel
* The platform which supports multiple target OS and hardware

This platform has following features to meet these requirements:
* Extend the TypeScript syntax to support event driven programming. The language is named [ArisiaScript](./Document/arisia-lang.md).
* Usual GUI parts are implemented as built-in components. See [component list](./Document/arisia-components.md).ã€€And there are some classes and functions to control them, see [Arisia Library](./Document/arisia-library.md).
* The application designed for Arisia Platform runs on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/).
